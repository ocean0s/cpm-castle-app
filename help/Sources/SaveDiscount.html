	<p>After playing, if you manage to get a discount, you will be offered to save it if you check that you are over 18.<br>
	Just type your ID in the text box and click save. If everything goes well, you will have your discount associated to your ID to use
	 in a future reservation. <br>
	 Note that if you had already saved a discount with your ID, you will have to use it before saving another one.</p>
